**C**ross-platform, **A**gnostic **C**ontinuous **I**ntegration

CACI is a tool to orchestrate continuous integration pipelines on your local machine. It is cross-platform and agnostic to any version control system. By leveraging hooks in common VCS tools, CACI provides the maximum flexibility to the user while emulating CI in the real world. CACI is like the Terraform/CDK to your local CI, but without the steep learning curve.

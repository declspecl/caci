**C**ross-platform, **A**gnostic **C**ontinuous **I**ntegration

`caci` is a tool to orchestrate continuous integration pipelines on your local machine. It is cross-platform and agnostic to any version control system. By leveraging hooks in common VCS tools, `caci` provides the maximum flexibility to the user while emulating CI in the real world. `caci` is like the Terraform/CDK to your local CI, but without the steep learning curve.
